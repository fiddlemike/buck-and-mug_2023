# buck-and-mug_2023
Repo for the Southern Faire 2023 Buck &amp; Mug magazine

The theme for the year will be Music at Faire: Past and Present.
We are looking for articles generally between 500 and 1000 words.  
We are looking for origin stories or funny anecdotes. We also are seeking
photographs where the musicians can be identified as well as time and place. 
If there is a special piece of music that defines faire for you we would 
like a few paragraphs describing why and the sheet music.

We would like all submissions by November 1, 2022.
