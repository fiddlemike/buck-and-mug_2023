Repo for the Southern Faire 2023 Buck &amp; Mug magazine

The Buck and Mug is a small publication at California Renaissance Faires containing articles, art and ads appealing to the Faire Community Vendors and Participants. It is published twice a year, once during Northern and once during Southern Faire.

The theme for the Southern Faire 2023 will be Music at Faire: Past and Present. We are looking for articles generally between 500 and 1000 words. We are looking for origin stories, funny anecdotes, musical musings, or any music related material. 

We also are seeking historical photographs from past Southern Faires where the musicians can be identified as well as time and place. 

If there is a special piece of music that defines faire for you, we would like a few paragraphs describing why and the sheet music.

We would like all submissions by November 1, 2022.
