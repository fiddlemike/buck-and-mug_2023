I will be the editor for the Southern Faireâ€™s 2023 Buck & Mug.

The theme for the Southern Faire 2023 will be Music at Faire: Past and Present. We are looking for articles generally between 500 and 1000 words. We are looking for origin stories, funny anecdotes, musical musings, or any music related material.

We also are seeking historical photographs from past Southern Faire's where the musicians or singers can be identified as well as time and place.

If there is a special piece of music that defines faire for you, we would like a few paragraphs describing why and the sheet music.

Submissions can be sent to michael62machado@gmail.com. Please make any submission by November 1, 2022.
